# pointerY | GSAP | Docs & Learning

### pointerY : Number

\[read-only\] The y (vertical) position of the pointer (mouse or touch) associated with the Draggable's last event (like event.pageY).

### Details[â€‹](#details "Direct link to Details")

_Number_ - The `y` (vertical) position of the pointer (mouse or touch) associated with the Draggable's last event (like `event.pageY`). In most cases, this should be used instead of using the event's `.pageY` because GSAP tries to normalize positioning across all browsers.
