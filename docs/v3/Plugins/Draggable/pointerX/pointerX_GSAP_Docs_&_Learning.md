# pointerX | GSAP | Docs & Learning

### pointerX : Number

\[read-only\] The x (horizontal) position of the pointer (mouse or touch) associated with the Draggable's last event (like event.pageX).

### Details[â€‹](#details "Direct link to Details")

_Number_ - The `x` (horizontal) position of the pointer (mouse or touch) associated with the Draggable's last event (like `event.pageX`). In most cases, this should be used instead of using the event's `.pageX` because GSAP tries to normalize positioning across all browsers.
