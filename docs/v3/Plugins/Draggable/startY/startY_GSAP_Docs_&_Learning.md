# startY | GSAP | Docs & Learning

### startY : Number

\[read-only\] The starting `y` (vertical) position of the Draggable instance when the most recent drag began.

### Details[â€‹](#details "Direct link to Details")

\[read-only\] The starting `y` (vertical) position of the Draggable instance when the most recent drag began. For a Draggable of `type: "x,y"`, it would be the `y` transform translation, as in the CSS `transform: translateY(...)`. For `type: "top,left"`, the Draggable's `y` would refer to the CSS `top` value that's applied. This is not the global coordinate - it is the inline CSS-related value applied to the element.
