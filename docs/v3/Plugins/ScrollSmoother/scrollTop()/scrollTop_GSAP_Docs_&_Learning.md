# scrollTop | GSAP | Docs & Learning

Immediately gets/sets the scroll position (in pixels). If you'd like to scroll to a particular element or position smoothly, see [scrollTo()](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollSmoother/scrollTo\(\))

```
let scroll = smoother.scrollTop();
```

You can use the [offset()](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollSmoother/offset\(\)) method to ascertain the position associated with a particular target element.

When you set the scroll position in this way, it will work even if [paused()](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollSmoother/paused\(\)) is `true`.
