# isEnabled | GSAP | Docs & Learning

### isEnabled : Boolean

Indicates whether or not the Observer is enabled. Use the `enable()` and `disable()` methods to set the state. When an Observer is disabled, it removes all of its event listeners from the target and obviously won't trigger any callbacks. There are `onEnable` and `onDisable` callbacks, though, which of course would be called when you enable/disable the Observer.
