### disable( ) : void

Disables the Observer, removing the necessary event listeners and firing the `onDisable` callback if the Observer wasn't already disabled.

### Details[â€‹](#details "Direct link to Details")

Disables the Observer, removing the necessary event listeners and firing the `onDisable` callback if the Observer wasn't already disabled. If you plan to disable it permanently, use `kill()` instead so that it also gets removed from the internal Array and can be made available for garbage collection.
