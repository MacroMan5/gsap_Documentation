#### Parameters

*   #### **revert**: boolean
    
    Determines whether or not the elements should be reverted to their pre-ScrollTriggered state after the ScrollTrigger is disabled. `true` by default.
    
*   #### **allowAnimation**: Boolean
    
    By default, any associated scrub animation will be paused but if allowAnimation is true, it won't pause() the animation.
