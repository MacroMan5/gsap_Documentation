## ScrollTrigger.clearScrollMemory

### ScrollTrigger.clearScrollMemory( scrollRestoration:String )

Clears any recorded scroll positions in ScrollTrigger so that no scroll positions get restored after a refresh(). Normally, this isn't necessary but in some frameworks that handle routing in unconventional ways, it can be useful.

#### Parameters

*   #### **scrollRestoration**: String
    
    If you'd like to explicitly set the [window.history.scrollRestoration](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/scrollRestoration) value, you can define `"auto"` or `"manual"`. By default it will use whatever it was when ScrollTrigger loaded.

You might also want to consider setting `window.history.scrollRestoration = "manual"` to prevent the browser from trying to restore the scroll position from its history (unrelated to ScrollTrigger).
