\[read-only\] The pin element (if one was defined). If selector text was used, like ".pin", the `pin` will be the element itself (not selector text)

```
let st = ScrollTrigger.create({  trigger: ".trigger",  pin: ".pin",  start: "top center",  end: "+=500",});console.log(st.pin); // pin element (not selector text)
```
