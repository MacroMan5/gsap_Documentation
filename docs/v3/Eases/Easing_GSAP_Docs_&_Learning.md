# Easing | GSAP | Docs & Learning

**Easing is the primary way to change the timing of your tweens.** Simply changing the ease can adjust the entire feel and personality of your animation. There are infinite eases that you can use in GSAP so we created the visualizer below to help you choose exactly the type of easing that you need.

## Ease Visualizer

*   Add point: ALT-CLICK on line
*   Toggle smooth/corner: ALT-CLICK anchor
*   Get handle from corner anchor: ALT-DRAG
*   Toggle select: SHIFT-CLICK anchor
*   Delete anchor: press DELETE key
*   Undo: CTRL-Z

gsap.to(target,

{

duration:2.5,

ease: "power1.out",

y: \-500

Coding tip - Default Easing

GSAP uses a default ease of `"power1.out"`. You can overwrite this in any tween by setting the `ease` property of that tween to another (valid) ease value. You can set a different default ease for GSAP by using [gsap.defaults()](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/gsap.defaults\(\)). You can also set defaults for particular [timelines](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline).

```
gsap.defaults({  ease: "power2.in",  duration: 1,});gsap.timeline({defaults: {ease: "power2.in"}})
```
