# progress | GSAP | Docs & Learning

### progress( value:Number, suppressEvents:Boolean ) : \[Number | self\]

\[override\] Gets or sets the tween's progress which is a value between 0 and 1 indicating the position of the virtual playhead (excluding repeats) where 0 is at the beginning, 0.5 is halfway complete, and 1 is complete.

#### Parameters

*   #### **value**: Number
    
    (default = `NaN`) - Omitting the parameter returns the current value (getter), whereas defining the parameter sets the value (setter) and returns the instance itself for easier chaining.
    
*   #### **suppressEvents**: Boolean
    
    (default = `false`) - If `true`, no events or callbacks will be triggered when the playhead moves to the new position.
    

### Returns : \[Number | self\][​](#returns--number--self "Direct link to returns--number--self")

Omitting the parameter returns the current value (getter), whereas defining the parameter sets the value (setter) and returns the instance itself for easier chaining.

### Details[​](#details "Direct link to Details")

Gets or sets the tween's progress which is a value between 0 and 1 indicating the position of the virtual playhead (excluding repeats) where 0 is at the beginning, 0.5 is halfway complete, and 1 is complete. If the tween has a non-zero `repeat` defined, progress and `totalProgress` will be different because `progress` doesn't include any repeats or repeatDelays whereas `totalProgress` does. For example, if a tween instance is set to repeat once, at the end of the first cycle `totalProgress` would only be 0.5 whereas `progress` would be 1. If you watched both properties over the course of the entire animation, you'd see progress go from 0 to 1 twice (once for each cycle) in the same time it takes the `totalProgress` to go from 0 to 1 once.

This method serves as both a getter and setter. Omitting the parameter returns the current value (getter), whereas defining the parameter sets the value (setter) and returns the instance itself for easier chaining, like `myTween.progress(0.5).play();`

```
//gets current progressvar progress = myTween.progress();//sets progress to one quarter finishedmyTween.progress(0.25);
```

If you're looking for the **eased** value, see the [ratio](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/ratio) property.
