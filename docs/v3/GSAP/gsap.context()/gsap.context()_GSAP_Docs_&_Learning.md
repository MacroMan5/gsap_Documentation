# gsap.context() | GSAP | Docs & Learning

added in v3.11.0

Quick Start

#### Minimal usage

```
let ctx = gsap.context(() => { gsap.to(...); gsap.from(...); gsap.timeline().to(...).to(...); ...});// then later...ctx.revert(); // BOOM! Every GSAP animation created in that function gets reverted!
```

useGSAP() hook for React

If you're using React, we've brought out a hook that abstracts away `gsap.context()` and handles animation cleanup for you!

[Head over to the React guide](https://gsap.com/resources/React/)

A `gsap.context()` offers two key benefits:

*   **Collects all GSAP animations and ScrollTriggers** that are created within the supplied function so that you can easily `revert()` or `kill()`**ALL** of them at once. No need to keep track of a bunch of variables, Arrays, etc. This is particularly useful in React modules or anywhere you need to be able to "clean up" by reverting elements to their original state.
*   \[optionally\] **Scopes all selector text to a particular Element or Ref**. This can help simplify your code quite a bit and avoid needing to create lots of [Refs](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html) in React/Angular. Any GSAP-related selector text inside the supplied function will only apply to descendants of the Element/Ref.

Let's say you've got a **big** block of GSAP code that's creating a bunch of different animations and you need to be able to `revert()` them all...

```
let ctx = gsap.context(() => { gsap.to(...); gsap.from(...); gsap.timeline().to(...).to(...); ...});// then later...ctx.revert(); // BOOM! Every GSAP animation created in that function gets reverted!
```

## Scoping selector text[​](#scoping-selector-text "Direct link to Scoping selector text")

You can optionally pass in an Element or [React Ref](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html) or [Angular ElementRef](https://angular.io/api/core/ElementRef) and then **all** the selector text in the supplied function will be scoped to that particular Element/Ref which can greatly simplify your code. No more creating a Ref for every element you want to animate!

```
let ctx = gsap.context(() => {  gsap.to(".box", {...}) // <- normal selector text, automatically scoped to myRefOrElement  gsap.from(".circle", {...});}, myRefOrElement); // <- scope!!!
```

The `scope` can be selector text itself like ".myClass", or an Element, React Ref or Angular ElementRef.

## Adding to a Context[​](#adding-to-a-context "Direct link to Adding to a Context")

Perhaps you need to set up event handlers (like mouse clicks) that create new animations that should also be collected in the Context, but obviously those events will occur AFTER the Context's function already executed. No problem! You can **add** **your own methods** to a Context object so that when they run, they'll automatically add any resulting GSAP animations/ScrollTriggers to the Context:

```
let ctx = gsap.context((self) => {  // use any arbitrary string as a name; it'll be added to the Context object, so in this case you can call ctx.onClick() later...  self.add("onClick", (e) => {    gsap.to(...); // <-- gets added to the Context!  });}, myRefOrElement);// now the Context has an onClick() method we can tap into and any animations in that function will get added to the ContextmyButton.addEventListener("click", (e) => ctx.onClick(e));
```

Or you can directly add things to the Context **immediately** like this (function as the first parameter):

```
// create contextlet ctx = gsap.context(() => {...});// then later, add to it:ctx.add(() => {  gsap.to(...); // now all these get added to the Context.  gsap.from(...);});
```

## Cleanup function[​](#cleanup-function "Direct link to Cleanup function")

You can optionally return a "cleanup function" that should be called if/when the context gets reverted. This can contain your own custom cleanup code:

```
let ctx = gsap.context(() => {  ...  return () => {    // my custom cleanup code. Called when ctx.revert() is triggered.  };});
```

You can return a clean up function in any `.add()` function too; They'll all get called when the Context's `revert()` is invoked.

In very uncommon situations, you may want to create certain GSAP animations and/or ScrollTriggers inside the function that should be **excluded from the Context** (not reverted/killed when the Context gets reverted/killed) in which case you can use an `ignore()` like this:

```
let ctx = gsap.context((self) => {  gsap.to(...); // <- will get reverted when ctx.revert() is called  self.ignore(() => {    gsap.to(...); // <- will NOT get reverted when ctx.revert() is called. Ignored, not recorded in the Context.  });});
```

## Tips & Caveats[​](#tips--caveats "Direct link to Tips & Caveats")

*   When `revert()` is called on a Context, it is **permanent** for the animations/ScrollTriggers it contained. They get reverted and killed and the Context clears itself out, making things eligible for garbage collection. But more animations could still be added after that and revert() could be called on the same Context _again_ to revert/kill those.
*   A Context is not meant to serve as a way of controlling animations. That's what [Timelines](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline) are for. A Context is simply for reverting/killing and for \[optionally\] defining a scope for selector text.
*   The Context object itself is passed to the function, so you can reference it easily, like `gsap.context((self) => { ... self.add(...); });`
*   `gsap.context()` was added in version **3.11.0**
