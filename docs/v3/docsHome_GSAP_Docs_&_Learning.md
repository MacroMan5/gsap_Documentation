## GSAP Overview

The Core contains **everything** you need to create blazingly fast, responsive animations for all browsers. Additional capabilities, like [Dragging](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/Draggable/), [Scroll Animation](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger) or [Morphing](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/MorphSVGPlugin) are tucked away in plugins. This allows the core to remain relatively small and lets you add features only when you need them.
